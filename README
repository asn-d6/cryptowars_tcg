Crypto game mechanics draft (Under heavy development):

Goal of game: Retrieve opponent's private key.

Each player starts with a 512-bit RSA assymetric key and 500 entropy.

Decks of cards can have a maximum of 60 cards and each player starts
the game with 5 cards randomly chosen from his deck. On the start of
each round, the player draws one card at random from his deck. Maximum
hand size is 7, in the end of the player's turn he has to discard
surplus cards.

[Entropy] 

Entropy is the building block of the cryptowars game - like energy is
in Pokemon and mana in MTG. Each player gains a steady amount of
entropy each round.

[Locations]

The core of the game are Locations:

Location cards represent places on the world where your agents can
"work", for example the Stockmarket, the player's Headquarters or a
shady bar. Of course agent work is all about information gathering.

Location cards protect your assymetric key and provide buffs to your
agents. Without location cards, enemy agents would be able to attack
your assymetric key directly. Location cards also enable the player to
deploy more agents, since each Location unlocks a number of slots on
the player's active area..

An agent in a friendly location protects it and grants buffs to the
player and to his agents. 
Enemy agents can try to infiltrate the location to steal information
from the agents already inside or to destroy the location if it's
unprotected.

[Agents]

Players deploy agents to do their deeds. They infiltrate the locations
of the opponent, guard the player's locations, attack other agents or
scan areas to discover the enemy's cards.  
Players can trivially generate pawn agents which are weak, but can
later be promoted to more advanced agents. 
Agents can be upgraded by training. Each agent can spend one round
training to gain a train token, and players can spend train tokens to
promote their agents.

A chart of the agent evolutions follows:

*
|- Pawn (Alice,Bob, etc.) Tier 1, Evolution 1
|
- Agent (Agent Alice, Agent Bob, etc.) Tier 1, Evolution 2
|
|- Agent, Level 2 (Agent Mallory, Agent Eve, etc.) Tier 2, Evolution 3
|
- Agent, Level 3 (Agent Mallory, Agent Eve, etc.) Tier 2, Evolution 4
|
|- Agent, Level 4 (Agent Trent, etc.) Tier 3, Evolution 5
*

There are two types of promotions:
* Promotion by card:
  Each agent can be promoted by using an Agent card. If the agent has
  the necessary train tokens that the Agent card needs, the agent can
  be promoted to that card's Agent.
  Promotion by card increases the Agent's tier.
* Promotion by evolution:
  Each Agent can be promoted by evolution if he has the necessary
  train tokens that his Tier needs.
  Practically, every agent of Evolution 1 or 3, can be promoted to
  Evolution 2 and 4 respectively, by spending the train tokens that
  his Tier needs.
  At the moment, a Tier 1, Evolution 1 agent needs 2 train tokens to
  become Tier 1, Evolution 2. And a Tier 2, Evolution 3 agent needs 4
  train tokens to become Tier2, Evolutin 4.
  Tier 3 agents are strong enough that don't need promotions by evolution. 

[Technology and Equipment]

Technology cards are cards that grant buffs to the player or to the
player's agents. 
Equipment cards are cards attached to agents offering special
abilities and stats. 

[Privacy]

Another core concept of cryptowars is the fact that everything is
hidden by default. Every technology, location or agent is played
hidden from the opponent, until he manages to discover it.

There are four kinds of cards: 'technology', 'agent', 'locations' and
'entropy':

Technology:
        These are cards that stay on the battlefield and help the
        player and his agents.
Equipment:
        These cards represent equipment attached to agents that help
        them in various ways.
Agent:
        These are agent upgrades. Pawn agents can be upgraded to more
        advanved units, using the agent cards. This way the gain
        advanced abilities and statistics.
Locations:
        Location guards represent locations in the game world. PLayers
        have to deploy agents to interact with locations to win.
        
[Infiltration and espionage]

It's a tough job for an agent to infiltrate a location, let alone stay
in there undetected to gather the necessary info.
The hardness of this task depends on many factors:
Each location has two stats: Traceability and Difficulty
Traceability signifies how hard it is for an agent to discover the
location in the first place, and Difficulty signifies how hard it is
for an agent to remain undetected in that location.

Every round an agent remains hidden in an enemy base, the skill check
to succeed in remaining undetected becomes harder but the damage that
the agent inflicts to the opponent is increased respectively as
well. 

After all, it's harder for someone to stay unnoticed in a place for a
longer period of time, but if he manages he is getting deeper into it,
effectively increasing the damage that he deals.

[Damage] 

Damage to the opponent can be inflicted in various ways:
* When an agent has successfully infiltrated a guarded enemy base.
  In the Communication phase guards are sending information back to
  their base, infiltrators have the chance to capture that information
  to inflict damage to the opponent.
* When an agent kills another agent, he retrieves all the information
  the dead agent had effectively damaging the opponent.
* When an agent destroys an enemy base, damage is inflicted to the
  opponent.

[Travelling]

When an agent is deployed to a location, he has to travel there.
The agent is put into a Travelling state, which is visible to the
opponent, for a round.

[Rogue agents]

If an agent has to return to the player's active area after a mission
was completed but the player has no active slots in his active area,
that agent becomes a rogue agent.
Lore-wise he is roaming around the globe, trying to get back to his
active area but he carries precious information and he is vulnerable. 
If an opponent captures him, he deals extra damage to the rogue's player.
In the upkeep of the rogue's player the player can call him back to
the active area if he has opened some slots.
   
Each game round has the following phases which are composed by
individual acts:
    * Upkeep:
      [U1] Gain entropy.
      [U2] Upkeep effects
      [U3] Player draws one card.
      [U4] Agent arrival
      [U5] Stealth rolls 
      [U6] COllect rogue agents
    * Active phase:
      [A1] Players generate pawns (Alices/Bobs etc.) OR
      [[A2] Players may play cards from their hands.
      [A3] Players may train their agents.
      [A4] Players may promote their agents.
      ([A5] Players may deploy agents.)]
    * Battle phase
      [B1] Detected combat.
    * Communication phase
      [C1] Players may play cards from their hands.
      ([C2] Players may deploy agents.)
      [C3] Damage calculation for infiltrated agents 
    * End round:
      [E1] 'End of the round' effects take place.
      [E2] Player with more than 7 cards, discards cards.

[U1] Gain entropy:
     In this act, each player gains a predetermined amount of entropy.
     In the future, upkeep entropy will be able to be increased.
[U2] Upkeep effects:
     Cards with upkeep effects happen now.
[U3] Player draws one card
[U4] Agent arrival:
     Agents that were travelling reach their destination in this act. 
[U5] Stealth rolls:
     Guards in breached locations are rolling passive stealth checks
     in this act to detect the attackers.  
[U6] Collect rogue agents:
     Players with agents gone rogue now have the chance to collect
     them if they have space in their active areas.
     
[A1] Players generate pawns (Alices/Bobs etc.):
     Players may spend an amount of entropy to generate a pawn agent.
     Pawn agents come into play tapped and players that generate pawn
     agents lose the rest of their Active Phase.
[A2] Players may play cards from their hands:
     Players can play technology/equipment/location cards in this act.
[A3] Players may train their agents
[A4] Players may promote their agentsO
[A5] Players may deploy agents.
     Players can move agents to friendly or enemy locations, or put
     agents currently in locations back to their active areas.
     
[B1] Detected combat.
     Guards that detected infiltrators in their locations, can now take
     action. They can either decide to confront physically the attacker or
     leave him be for the moment.
[C1] Players may play cards from their hands.
[C2] Players may deploy agents.
     Players that didn't deploy agents in the Active Phase can do it now. 
[C3] Damage calculation for infiltrated agents 
     If an agent has succesfully infiltrated a guarded location, damage is
     inflicted to the location's player in this act.
     
[E1] 'End of the round' effects take place.
[E2] Player with more than 7 cards, discards cards.
